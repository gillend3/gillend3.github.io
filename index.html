    <h1>Getting Into The Flow</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Sometimes, when we are writing, we get into our own heads. Was that really the right word to use? Did I <br>spell it right? Maybe I should check the thesaurus for a better one. All of this fiddling and fussing<br> takes you out of that flow state which is so important to writing – particularly the first draft, or what Adam<br> calls the “mud-slinging” phase. This app is designed to help you enter and maintain a deep flow state, that<br> magical place where the subconscious comes alive and produces wonders.<br></h2>
    <h2 class="subtitle"><u>Instructions:</u> It's a simple app: you just type in the box. The only catch is this - no deletions, <br>no corrections. Just keep moving forward.</h2>
